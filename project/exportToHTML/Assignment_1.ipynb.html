</span><span class="s1"># Assignment 1: Signal type classification 
 
**Deadline**: Jan 31, 2024 
 
**Submission: Submit a PDF export of the completed notebook as well as the .ipynb file.** 
 
 
 
In this assignment, we will build Neural Networks models to predict types of signals.  The file `raw_data.csv` contains 20,000 signals each having 501 time samples and labels. 
 
 
**Note** that you are not allowed to import additional packages in this assignment **(especially not PyTorch)**. One of the objectives is to understand how the training procedure actually operates, before working with PyTorch's autograd engine which does it all for us.

<span class="s0">#%% md 
</span><span class="s1">When we split the data into a train test split, we want to make sure that no same spectrogram data ends up in both the training and test set. 
 
Explain why it would be problematic to have 
some spectrograms data in the training set, and other same spectrograms data in the 
test set. (Hint: Remember that we want our test accuracy to predict how well the model 
will perform in practice on a data it hasn't learned about.) 
</span><span class="s0">#%% md 
</span><span class="s1">#### Write your explanation here: 
If the same data is in both the training and test sets, the model will be able to recognize the data and may perform well on the test set even if it has not learned the underlying patterns. This can lead to an overestimation of the model’s accuracy and make it difficult to evaluate the performance of the model on new data (which it didn't learn). 
 
</span><span class="s0">#%% md 
</span><span class="s1">### Part (b) -- 7% 
 
It can be beneficial to **normalize** the columns, so that each column (feature) 
has the *same mean and standard deviation*. 
</span><span class="s0">#%% 
</span><span class="s1">feature_means = train_df.mean()[</span><span class="s4">1</span><span class="s1">:].to_numpy() </span><span class="s0"># the [1:] removes the mean of the &quot;class&quot; field</span>

<span class="s1">train_xs_norm = (train_xs - feature_means) / feature_stds</span>
<span class="s1">test_xs_norm = (test_xs - feature_means) / feature_stds</span>
<span class="s0">#%% md 
</span><span class="s1">Notice how in our code, we normalized the test set using the *training data means and standard deviations*. 
This is *not* a bug. 
 
Explain why it would be improper to compute and use test set means 
and standard deviations. (Hint: Remember what we want to use the test accuracy to measure.) 
 
</span><span class="s0">#%% md 
</span><span class="s1">#### Write your explanation here: 
The test set is supposed to represent new, unseen data that the model has not been trained on. If we use the mean and standard deviation of the test set to normalize the test set we would be introducing information from the test set into the model which can lead to optimistic performance estimates. 
</span><span class="s0">#%% md 
</span><span class="s1">### Part (c) -- 7% 
 
Finally, we'll move some of the data in our training set into a validation set. 
 
Explain why we should limit how many times we use the test set, and that we should use the validation 
set during the model building process.

<span class="s0">#%% md 
</span><span class="s1">#### Write your explanation here: 
The test set is supposed to be used to evaluate the model's performance so we don't want the model to use it before it's trained and tuned. 
If we use the test set multiple times during the model building process, we would be introducing information from the test set into the model. 
 
The validation set is used to evaluate the performance of the model during training and to tune the model’s hyperparameters. By using a validation set, we can ensure that the model is not influenced by information from the test set and that its performance estimates are reliable.

$\mu$ controls how much the model weights are updated during the training, what size of &quot;steps&quot; we take in the negative derivative direction. 
If $\mu$ is too small we might get stuck in a local minimum and the model will learn very slowly so the loss and accuracy will change very little after each iteration. 
If $\mu$ is too big we might step over the universal minimum (or some other minimum which is good enough) and miss the optimal solution. The model might learn very quickly but the loss and accuracy might fluctuate alot. 
If $\mu$ is in between we have better chances at finding a good minimum and the model will learn moderately. So the loss and accuracy will decrease steadily after each iteration.

When the data is normalized this ensures that no one feature dominates the others so the algorithm can learn from all the features equally. Normalization scales the features to a similar range which can help the gradient descent to find the optimal solution more efficiently (converge faster). 
When the data is not normalized the algorithm may take longer to converge or may not converge at all especially if the features have very different scales. In the graphs above you can clearly see that the graphs for the not normalized data don't converge and fluctuate alot.

I used the normalized data. 
$\mu$: 
I choose the $\mu$ to be not too small and not too big so the gradient descent will converge steadily (not too fast and not too slow), found it by comparing different $\mu$s above (from the plot in section (d)). You can see that $\mu$=0.2 converges fast enough and arrives at a somewhat constant loss and accuracy, meaning that the w and b are good. Same for batch size. 
Batch size: 
Large batch size can lead to faster convergence and higher accuracy but it can cause the algorithm to get stuck in a local minimum. A smaller batch size can lead to slower convergence and lower accuracy but it can help the algorithm to escape from local minima.

The three values are slightly different. That makes sense because they are calculated on different data sets. The training data's accuracy tends to be higher because we train the model on it and the validation and test accuracies tends to be close because they are both unseen data.

Writing a classifier like this is instructive, and helps you understand what happens when 
we train a model. However, in practice, we rarely write model building and training code 
from scratch. Instead, we typically use one of the well-tested libraries available in a package. 
 
Use `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression` to build a linear classifier, and make predictions about the test set. Start by reading the 
[API documentation here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html).

We trained the model with MSE loss function for a classification problem, this is not an ideal loss function for classification. 
 
Please explain why using MSE loss function is not an ideal loss function for a classification problem and suggest a more suitable loss function for a classification problem. 
</span><span class="s0">#%% md 
</span><span class="s1">#### Write your explanation here: 
The main issue with MSE loss function for classification is that it is not well-suited to the discrete nature of the output variable (0 and 1 in out case). The MSE loss function penalizes large errors between the predicted and actual values. It can produce gradients that are too small or too large which can cause the model to converge slowly or diverge. 
A more suitable loss function is the cross entropy loss function. It is designed to handle the discrete nature of the output variable by measuring the difference between the predicted and actual probability distributions.
